### Vite Overview

Vite is a modern build tool that offers a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects. It provides:

- **Instant Server Start**: Vite leverages native ES modules, allowing the development server to start almost instantly.
- **Lightning-Fast HMR**: Vite's fast hot module replacement ensures instant updates to the browser without losing the application state.
- **Optimized Build**: Vite uses Rollup to bundle your code for production, ensuring highly optimized output.
- **Out-of-the-Box Support for Modern JavaScript**: Supports ES6+, TypeScript, JSX, and other modern features.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem for extending functionality.

### How Vite Works

- **Development**: Vite serves source files directly using native ES modules, leading to a faster and more efficient development server.
- **Build**: Uses Rollup to bundle modules into optimized output, including code splitting and tree-shaking.


### Deployment on Netlify

Netlify is a platform for deploying modern web projects. To deploy this project on Netlify:
