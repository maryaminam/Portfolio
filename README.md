Vite Overview
Vite is a modern build tool that offers a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects. It provides:
•	Instant Server Start: Vite leverages native ES modules, allowing the development server to start almost instantly.
•	Lightning-Fast HMR: Vite's fast hot module replacement ensures instant updates to the browser without losing the application state.
•	Optimized Build: Vite uses Rollup to bundle your code for production, ensuring highly optimized output.
•	Out-of-the-Box Support for Modern JavaScript: Supports ES6+, TypeScript, JSX, and other modern features.
•	Plugin Ecosystem: Rich plugin ecosystem for extending functionality.
How Vite Works
•	Development: Vite serves source files directly using native ES modules, leading to a faster and more efficient development server.
•	Build: Uses Rollup to bundle modules into optimized output, including code splitting and tree-shaking.
Getting Started with Vite
1.	Create a new Vite project:
bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd <project-name>
3.	Install dependencies:

Deployment on Netlify
Netlify is a platform for deploying modern web projects. To deploy this project on Netlify:
1.	Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.	Log in to Netlify and create a new site:
o	Click "New site from Git".
o	Connect your Git repository.
o	Configure the build settings:
	Build command: npm run build
	Publish directory: dist
3.	Deploy the site: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.
Conclusion
This React application, built using Vite and deployed on Netlify, provides a robust and efficient structure for a portfolio website. The combination of modular components, Vite's advanced development and build tools, and Netlify's seamless deployment process ensures a high-performance, maintainable project.
Feel free to customize the components and add more features to make this portfolio your own!
